# ðŸš€ AutoCode-Builder
AutoCode Builder is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users generate pre-structured code files quickly. It runs on the Linux terminal and allows users to select a programming language, provide a filename, and add a description. The system then creates the corresponding file with a predefined template. If a file with the same name already exists, it automatically moves the old file to a backup folder before generating a new one.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Supports multiple programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, etc.).
- Generates files with pre-written code templates.
- Creates a backup when regenerating an existing file.
- Runs entirely on the Linux terminal (Tested on Oracle Linux).
